# Employee-Churn-Prediction-App
This is my Employee Churn Prediction App — a full-stack project that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company or stay based on various features. I built this to practice real-world machine learning deployment and help HR teams make data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Employee churn (or turnover) is a big challenge for many companies. Losing skilled employees affects productivity and increases hiring costs. So I built this web app to predict churn using machine learning — helping organizations identify employees at risk of leaving before it happens.
This app takes employee data through a clean front-end UI, applies a trained model, and gives instant predictions along with accuracy metrics.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Predict employee churn using ML
- Clean and simple UI using Flask
- Trained on common HR features such as satisfaction level, evaluation score, number of projects, etc.
- Uses data preprocessing and model evaluation
- Realistic and practical use case for HR analytics

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask 
- Scikit-Learn 
- Pandas & NumPy
- Joblib

## 🚧 How It Works
- User enters employee details in the app
- Input gets pre-processed using saved scaler
- Model predicts churn (Yes/No)
- Result is shown instantly in UI

## 📊 Model Performance & Accuracy
After experimenting with multiple machine learning models and tuning the hyperparameters, I finalized the best-performing model based on overall performance and stability.
