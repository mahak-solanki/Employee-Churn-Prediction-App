# Employee-Churn-Prediction-App
### This is my Employee Churn Prediction App — a full-stack project that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company or stay based on various features. I built this to practice real-world machine learning deployment and help HR teams make data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
### Employee churn (or turnover) is a big challenge for many companies. Losing skilled employees affects productivity and increases hiring costs. So I built this web app to predict churn using machine learning — helping organizations identify employees at risk of leaving before it happens.
### This app takes employee data through a clean front-end UI, applies a trained model, and gives instant predictions along with accuracy metrics.
